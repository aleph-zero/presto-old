# Possible Bugs
###

 * Are we using javax.inject.Inject everywhere? I think I saw some usages of com.google.inject.Inject.

###
# Improvements
###

 * Split logic needs:
    - isRemotelyAccessible() true or false
    - See: SimpleNodeSelector.computeAssignments()
    - See: NodeScheduler.selectExactNodes()
    - See: SourcePartitionedScheduler.schedule()

 * Splits:
    - Currently restricting each split's host list to a single host until I can dig down
      and really understand the placement policy.

 * Preference:
    - How does preference _local, _primary interact with my split policy and Presto's placement
      policy?

 * Slice policy:
    - How should it work when we are querying multiple indices, either through and alias or by
      explicitly listing >1 index in the query?

 * Try implementing table partitioning logic in ElasticsearchMetadata. See RaptorMetadata for an example.
    - Also in getTableLayouts()

   - Make the scheduler evenly distributes the work:
        a) if you have, Presto on every data node, and your data is balanced, use hive.force-local-scheduling=true
            in the catalog/hive.properties
        b) if you don't have Presto on every data node, then you will want to
            set node-scheduler.location-aware-scheduling-enabled in config.properties which will cause the
            scheduler to ignore locality and maximize parallelism.
